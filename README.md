# Elixochat

Elixochat is a small web chat application. Users can connect to a common lobby and chat with other users.
Elixochat also supports "private" rooms. Those "private" rooms can only be joined by users that know the name of the room.

## Running the app
If you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed, just run:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

then, visit: [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## Motivations
I'm currently learning Phoenix and all things related to Elixir and Erlang/OTP. 

I also love chats, so I decided to build one.

## Technologies
The frontend is a standard create-react-app app.

I used [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/), an Elixir web framework to build the backend.
